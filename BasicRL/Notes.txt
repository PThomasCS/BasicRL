TODO:
1. Look into not re-running all agents/environments.
2. Look into loading hyperparameters from files
3. Look into running many environments.
4. Expected Sarsa
5. REINFORCE
6. Policy gradient using TD(lambda) to estimate q^pi, and then using the PGT to get an update from q^pi.
7. Backwards-REINFORCE (after deriving it)
8. Acrobot - Runge Kutta
9. Pendulum - dynamics are in this paper (near the end): https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~todorov/courses/amath579/reading/Continuous.pdf
10. Look into drawing episodes. Put this between #ifdef guards so we can easily remove it.
	#define _USE_GRAPHICS
	#ifdef _USE_GRAPHICS
		code here
	#endif

	Recommend using cimg: https://cimg.eu/ (should only need one header file in the lib folder!)
11. Tile coding
12. Hyperparameter optimiztion

Random C++ Notes
1. We try to avoid "using namespace" in header (.h and .hpp) files, since doing so forces all files including the header to use the same namespaces.
2. The Agent and Environment classes are "abstract". They use "virtual" functions - functions that child classes can overwrite. The virtual functions with " = 0"" in their declaration *must* be overwritten by children classes.
3. Because the Agent and Environment classes are abstract, you cannot create an Agent or Environment object - but you can create instantiations of subclasses (like Sarsa and Gridworld).
4. Although you cannot have an object that is just an Agent or Environment, you *can* pass pointers to Environment and Agent objects. 
5. We place all of our includes in stdafx.hpp (the name comes from old C++ reasons), and files then only need to include "stdafx.hpp" to get all of the includes.
6. "#pragma once" tells the compiler to only ever copy-paste the file contents a single time when the file is first #include-ed.
7. & means "by reference". We use it with function arguments to say "pass the actual object, not a copy."
8. An int* or Object* is a "pointer" to an integer or Object. This is just the address in memory.
9. For an object X you would write X.functionName(). If P is a pointer to X, you would write P->functionName();
